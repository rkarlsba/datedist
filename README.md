## Synopsis

datedist is used to distribute files, typically photos or other media files, to subdirectories named YYYY/MM/DD, also allowing other resolutions (only months, or added date etc)

## Motivation

I had a few thousand files and wanted to sort them into subdirs

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.
